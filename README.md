### 🚀 Featured Projects

- **[Calibcam: Multi-camera stereo calibration software](https://github.com/bbo-lab/calibcam)**
  A charuco based calibrator for multi-camera setups, including omnidirectional cameras. It extends OpenCV’s calibration functionality by adding an optimization routine to estimate intrinsic and extrinsic parameters for multi-camera setups using SciPy and JAX.

- **[Bbo-labelgui-qt: A PyQt based GUI for guided data labeling](https://github.com/bbo-lab/bbo-labelgui-qt)**
  A fast and light PyQt based GUI for manual labeling of pre-defined key-points/markers in images, built for animal behavioral datasets.

- **[Calipy: GUI for viewing "calibcam" camera calibration results](https://github.com/bbo-lab/calipy)**
